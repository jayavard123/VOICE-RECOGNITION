# Speech Processing App

This is a simple speech processing application built with Python.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Uses SpeechRecognition library to recognize speech input.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilizes spaCy for NLP tasks like tokenization and keyword matching.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Converts generated responses to speech using pyttsx3.
- **GUI Interface**: Developed using Tkinter, providing buttons for recording, stopping, and clearing text.
- **Threading**: Ensures responsiveness by using threading for speech recognition.
- **Background Image**: Includes a background image for visual appeal.

## Usage

1. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script: `python speech_app.py`
3. Click "Start Recording" to begin speech recognition.
4. Speak into the microphone, and the recognized speech will appear in the input text area.
5. The application will generate a response based on the input and display it in the output text area.
6. The response will also be played back as speech.
7. Click "Stop Recording" to halt speech recognition.
